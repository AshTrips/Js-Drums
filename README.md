# Js Drums
 A basic drumming page using JavaScript
I devised a method to play any music in wav format using the keyboard with a JavaScript code.
It fundamentally links the sounds to the page and allows us to also highlight the selected key when we press it.
I have use the lowercase keys of the keyboard here. Those are - Z,X,C,V,B,N & M.
